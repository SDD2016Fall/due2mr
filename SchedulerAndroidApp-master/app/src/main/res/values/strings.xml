    <string name="aboutText"> Scheduler is an android application, which aims at helping users manage their time efficiently. It is simple and easy to use, it reminds users of saved schedules via notifications, and every user of this application will not have to go through the stress of remembering his/her activities.</string>
=======
    <string name="aboutText"> Our project, called due 2mr, is a day-matter software for Android to remind RPI students of upcoming due dates.  Many RPI students have more than four courses per semester and often have more than one assignment due in one day. It can be hard for them to remember when every assignment is due. Even if students remember due dates, it can be even harder for them to manage time appropriately. Our APP will solve both of these problems. Students can set up their due dates manually for each course (like a lab due each Tuesday).  Once set up, our APP will display the number of days left for due days, and remind users when the time remaining is less than one week by sending users a notification.</string>
